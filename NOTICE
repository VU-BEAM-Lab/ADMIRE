The following copyright applies to the files in Section #3: Copyright Stephen Hsu
Permission was obtained from Stephen Hsu to include these files in this repository.
Both of these files were modified by Christopher Khan in 2020. The modification to 
scmap.m was that the speed of sound in m/s was added as an input to the scmap function. 
The modification to sconvert.m was that the speed of sound in m/s was added as an input
to the scan_convert function and as an input in the scmap function call.

Section #3 {

scmap.m 
sconvert.m

}

The files in Section #4 were developed by modifying existing Verasonics sequence acquisition scripts.
SetUpL7_4_RyLns_ADMIRE.m was developed by modifying SetUpL7_4_128RyLns.m, and SetUpC5_2_RyLns_ADMIRE.m
was developed by modifying SetUpC5_2_128_RyLns.m. The last modifications to these files were made by 
Christopher Khan in 2020.

Section #4 {

SetUpL7_4_RyLns_ADMIRE.m
SetUpC5_2_RyLns_ADMIRE.m

}

The code for the file in Section #5 was obtained from the paper "A Tutorial on Independent Component Analysis" by Jonathon Shlens.
